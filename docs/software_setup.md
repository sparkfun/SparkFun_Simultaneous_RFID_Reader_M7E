	If this is your first time using Arduino, please read through our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide). If you have not installed an Arduino library before, we recommend you check out our [installation guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library).

The SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Tag Reader Arduino library, while originally written for the M6E-NANO, works just as well for the M7E-HECTO on this RFID Reader breakout. The library handles all serial communication, byte manipulations, and CRC verifications making it easy to quickly get started using the board. Users can download and install the library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for <b>"SparkFun Simultaneous RFID"</b> and selecting the latest version. If you prefer to manually install the library, download a ZIP of it by clicking the button below:

With the library installed, let's take a closer look at some of the examples included in it. You can take a look at them by navigating to <b>File > Examples > SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Tag Reader Library > Examples</b>.
