## UART Switch Position & Software Serial

Make sure the Serial Selection Switch is in the <b>"SER"</b> position when using this library. All of the examples in this Arduino library use the [Software Serial Library](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial/) so if you are not using the SparkFun RedBoard IoT and following the assembly instructions in the Hardware Assembly section, make sure to connect the RX/TX pins on the SER header to compatible pins on your chosen development board. Note, this library 

## Example 1 - Constant Read

The first example sets the M7E to constantly scan and report any tags it sees in the vicinity. 

## Example 2 - Read EPC

## Example 3 - Write EPC

## Example 4 - Read User Data
